The default commit depth is 500 commits which strikes a good balance between speed and coverage, but it can of course be adjusted with a command line option. That old .bash_history file that was accidentally pushed and deleted 300 commits ago? Gitrob will find it.</p><h4 id=no-more-postgresql-database class="scroll-mt-8 group">No more PostgreSQL database

The new version simply serves up findings directly from memory, but can also be saved to special session files which can later be loaded again and shared with other people. The session files contain a simple JSON document which is also ideal for parsing and integration with other tools and systems.</p><h4 id=no-more-ruby-dependency-hell class="scroll-mt-8 group">No more Ruby dependency hell

Because the new version is written in Go, the whole tool is now a simple compiled binary that runs on Linux, Mac and Windows. No more fighting with RVM and native extensions that won&rsquo;t compile!</p><h4 id=new-sleek-web-ui class="scroll-mt-8 group">New, sleek web UI
