</title><meta name=description content="I am currently a PhD student in Political Science at Northeastern University, where I explore how data science can help us better understand social phenomena. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Bogazici University, followed by a Master’s in Middle East Studies from METU. This background has naturally led me to a research focus that sits at the intersection of social science and computational methods.
My work centers on using social network analysis and computational text analysis to study issues like online polarization and the dynamics of online extremism. I approach these challenges with the understanding that every insight, however modest, can contribute to a clearer picture of our digital world. Throughout my studies and research, I have sought to maintain a spirit of curiosity and humility, recognizing that learning is an ongoing process."><link rel=icon type=image/svg+xml href=https://tapanyemre.github.io/blog/images/favicon.svg><link rel=icon type=image/png href=https://tapanyemre.github.io/blog/images/favicon.png><meta property="og:url" content="https://tapanyemre.github.io/blog/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yunus Emre Tapan"><meta property="og:title" content="About me"><meta property="og:description" content="I am currently a PhD student in Political Science at Northeastern University, where I explore how data science can help us better understand social phenomena.

Whether working as a teaching assistant for courses such as Comparative Politics, Globalization, or International Relations, I always strive to help students engage critically with complex ideas. My teaching roles have been complemented by experiences as a visiting lecturer and co-organizer for events like the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Istanbul—each experience has enriched my perspective and deepened my commitment to both teaching and learning.</p><p>I also lead the Istanbul Twitter Developer Community, where I work with fellow professionals to foster collaboration and share insights on using digital tools for research. I am grateful for the opportunities to contribute to research projects and fellowships that have broadened my understanding of digital trace data and its potential to inform public discourse.</p><p>Ultimately, my work is driven by a commitment to both rigorous inquiry and community engagement. I believe that a thoughtful, data-informed approach can help bridge the gap between academic research and real-world challenges, and I remain dedicated to modestly advancing our collective understanding in these areas.</p><p>You can also find me on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunus-emre-tapan-39a93648/>LinkedIn</a> where I post more frequent, bite-sized updates and thoughts.</p></article></main><footer class="mt-20 border-t border-neutral-100 pt-2 text-xs"></footer></div></body></html>
